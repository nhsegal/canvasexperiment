# The Wave Game
I originally wrote this using p5.js, then I refactored it to use webpack, then refactored it again to use the html canvas element without the p5.js library. 

It is clearly indebted to PhET's Waves on a String sim, but I believe it has some worthwhile, novel features. The challenges direct the user's attention to how waves reflect and interfere.
