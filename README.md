# The Wave Game
I originally wrote this using p5.js, then I refactored it to take advantage of webpack and linting. Then, partly because the code bundles were so big, I refactored the sim again to use the html canvas element without the p5.js library. It is my first real program directly manipulating the canvas.

The game is based on some demos I would do with a slinky and paper cups. It is clearly indebted to PhET's Waves on a String sim, but I believe it has some worthwhile, novel features. The levels direct the user's attention to how waves reflect and interfere and how these relate to standing waves.
